                                <p>This was a great stop on our road trip. We didn't have a lot of time in Napa but having this lovely,
                                    unique accommodation made it very special. Tom also provided very helpful tips on good wineries to
                                    visit with limited time - Paju, Hall and Fremont diner for lunch on our way to San Fransisco
                                    were exactly the right mix for us. I'd recommend staying in the Silver Cloud if you are after
                                    something a bit different and cosy, with everything you need for a short stay. Thanks Tom and Judy.
